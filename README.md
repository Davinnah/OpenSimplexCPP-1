# OpenSimplexCPP

Derived from Stephen M. Cameron's C port of Kurt Spencer's Java implementation.

The goal is to produce an OpenSimplex implementation that does not perform any dynamic allocation and has no dependencies on standard headers. This not only makes it portable across operating systems but enables it to run in most GPU compute environments (CUDA, Metal, OpenCL C++).

As always, issues and pull requests are welcome.
